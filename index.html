            <p id="mission-text">Hi reader! We are a group of college students who are passionate about water conservation and 
                sustainability. While water is a recyclable and infinite resource, there is a limited source. The quicker we use up our 
                clean water sources, the quicker they will deplete and put all of us into danger. This is why we created a website to 
                spread awareness about daily water usage and how you can start conserving water. In this website, you will find a water 
                usage calculator to measure your daily water usage and a resources page with tips on how to conserve water in your every 
                day life. Thank you for visiting and we hope you learn more about how you can help us contribute to a more sustainable 
                world!
